We are writing to you today because we understand you may be experiencing significant frustration with your current mobile service, and we want to ensure you receive the best possible value and experience with TriLink. We recognize that your current Limited_2GB plan, while initially affordable at $30 per month, has likely become unpredictable and costly due to frequent data overages, making it less suitable for typical usage, especially for a 16-year-old.

To further enhance your connectivity and value, we also offer the option to bundle this with our high-speed 100Mbps home internet service for an additional $40 per month. This powerful combination will provide seamless connectivity for your entire household, supporting everything from remote learning and work to entertainment and browsing.
